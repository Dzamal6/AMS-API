def handle_response(response) -> dict:
  """
  Processes a response from an API and converts it into a structured dictionary format that categorizes different types of response elements such as text, choices, visuals, and cards.

  Parameters:
      response (requests.Response): The response object from a requests library call which is expected to contain JSON content.

  Returns:
      dict: A structured dictionary where each key corresponds to a block of the response with details on the type and content of the block, such as text messages, images, or choice buttons.

  Note:
      This function expects the response data to be in a specific format and includes error handling for specific error structures. It also calls `handle_buttons` to process any button elements within the response.
